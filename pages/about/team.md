[Dr. Jonathan Vigh](https://staff.ral.ucar.edu/jvigh/) (Project Scientist I, Research Applications Laboratory at the National Center for Atmospheric Research) works at the intersection of atmospheric science, data science, and weather/climate risk. Dr. Vigh has expertise in tropical meteorology and tropical cyclone dynamics. Dr. Vigh has studied the problem of eye formation in hurricanes to learn how the eye/eyewall structure impacts the subsequent intensification of the storm. Dr. Vigh has also done extensive work to construct [aircraft-based data sets](https://verif.rap.ucar.edu/tcdata/flight/) and a [historical database](https://verif.rap.ucar.edu/tcdata/historical/) to further investigate structure and intensity changes in tropical cyclones, with a particular focus on the radius of maximum winds (RMW). Dr. Vigh is the lead developer of the [Tropical Cyclone Guidance Project (TCGP)](http://hurricanes.ral.ucar.edu/) and the [Climate Risk Management engine (CRMe)](https://verif.rap.ucar.edu/jntweb/crme/). Dr. Vigh is the Principal Investigator of this project and the HurricaneRiskCalculator project.
